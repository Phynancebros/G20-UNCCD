This repository contains the comprehensive data analysis and geospatial processing carried out for the G20-UN Restoration Project. Our work focuses on assessing global ecosystem restoration opportunities, evaluating climate risk, land degradation, and biodiversity hotspots, as well as identifying optimal locations for nature-based solutions. We utilized datasets from renowned data providers, including FAO, World Resources Institute (WRI), Copernicus, World Bank, IPCC, and OpenStreetMap (OSM), to ensure robust and accurate results. The analyses include geospatial modeling, climate scenario projections, biodiversity assessments, and population impact evaluations to support strategic decision-making for ecosystem restoration efforts globally.
